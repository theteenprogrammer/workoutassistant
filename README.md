I intend it to be more than a timer


It's gonna be like a timer for a workout as a web app and it's going to have some other features like background music and sounds for the transition period per exercise.
I also intend there to be a community-like nature to it in a similar way as quizlet where you can access other people's workouts. There may also be a reference for muscles used for each exercise available.
I may also create an algorithm that uses form data to create custom workouts for people to help with muscle imbalances or fitness goals.
